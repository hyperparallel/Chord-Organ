# Chord-Organ
proof of concept only. Twist the chord pot and it will jump to a user defined waveform and edit it on the fly!

If you change the pitch push the button and turn the pot again to clear out the other waveforms.

Couldn't find a proper wavefolding formula so just made this. 
Needs a log response from the pot. 
Would benefit from no quantisation.

Whoop!
